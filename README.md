# knick-knacks
This is a collection of small scripts that I find either useful or fun in some 
way, but aren't large enough for a seperate repository.

## pyaudio
this thing is used to convert and download mp3 files from youtube. you can either
download using a URL or you can search with key words and download the first result.

## pynba
use this tool to display game schedules/results for various leagues (NBA, NHL,
NFL, MLB).

## clisearch 
This is supposed to be used to search the web and to display the first 10 results. 
when you select a link, it spits out the html code for that webpage
